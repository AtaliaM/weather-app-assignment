# ❄️ Weather App ☀️
This is a little weather application I built with React (with hooks) and Redux.
In the app you can search for any city around the world, and get the current weather + next three days forecast for that city (if it's available in Metaweather API 😉).
I personally prefer warm weather but I won't mind if you use it to plan a trip to Siberia.🥶
Hope you enjoy!
